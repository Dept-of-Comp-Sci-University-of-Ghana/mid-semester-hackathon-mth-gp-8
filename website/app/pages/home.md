<h1>Welcome to Group 11's project.</h1>
<p>Our project was to build a moderation system that flagged english, ewe, ga, and twi words based on if they were insults.</p>
<p>Type in a text and our model will analyze your entry for insults</p>


<form class="d-flex form-group green-border-focus" action="/form1/">
  <div class="form-group">
  <!-- <input class="form-control form-control-lg" name="query" type="search" placeholder="Enter text..." aria-label="Search"> -->
  <textarea class="form-control" name=query id="exampleFormControlTextarea4" rows="7" placeholder="Write a text..."></textarea>
  </div>
  <button class="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit">Search</button>

</form>
